jstut is a JavaScript documentation tool intended to make creating interactive,
tutorial style documentation easily.  To this end, it can also do a lot of
things other documentation tools can do (and many they cannot).

Reasonably fancy things supported:
- Parses and abstractly interprets JS, understanding various OO idioms as well
   as require() and define() module abstractions.
- Fancy syntax highlighting in examples based on understanding of JS.

Limitations:
- Only understands through ES5 right now, definitely not JS 1.8 fanciness.
