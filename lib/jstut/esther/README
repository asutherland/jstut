jstut esther => jstu testher => jstu tester

This is a test running framework that exists to let me run my jetpack-targeted
tests in the browser as well as via straight-up jetpack.  This is not meant to
be a testing framework that anyone else adopts.  Ideally it's just the jetpack
test runner adapted for asynchronous module definitions, support for overkill
logging, plus test duration logging.

This is co-located in jstut rather than on its own so that we can leverage
jstut's package-related code and maybe some ability to resolve exceptions to
the source code in a magical fashion at some point in the future.
