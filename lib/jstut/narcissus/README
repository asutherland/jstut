This is a copy of narcissus from jsctags.  It has the advantage of already
having been converted to CommonJS and jsctags being developed by a contributor
to upstream narcissus.  It also has gained some JS 1.8 magic that is generally
useful.  It loses the execution capabilities of narcissus but gains some
'abstract interpretation' capabilities that are probably most in line with what
we want out of narcissus anyways.  Specifically, we want to be able to map
symbols to their conceptual origin for the purposes of documentation.

The base copy is of:

I am also adding at least one new exported method for our parsing needs but
do not expect to make any meaningful changes that would result in conflicts.
